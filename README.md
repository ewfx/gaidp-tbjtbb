# Financial Data Validation System

## Overview
This project is a **Regulatory Reporting Validation System** that uses a combination of rule-based validation and AI-driven anomaly detection to ensure financial dataset integrity. It leverages a **lightweight open-source language model (FLAN-T5)** to generate validation rules and **Isolation Forest** to detect anomalies.

## Features
- **Automated Validation Rule Generation**: Uses an LLM to generate and explain financial validation rules.
- **Rule-Based Data Validation**: Checks for missing values, invalid entries, and negative values where applicable.
- **AI-Powered Anomaly Detection**: Detects outliers in financial data using **Isolation Forest**.
- **Detailed Reporting**: Generates a **Word report** summarizing the errors, anomalies, and validation rules.

## Prerequisites
Before running the script, install the required dependency:
```sh
pip install python-docx
```

## Running the Code in Google Colab
1. **Upload your financial dataset** (CSV or Excel file) to Google Colab.
2. **Run the script** and provide the file path when prompted.

```sh
📂 Enter the path to the CSV/Excel file: /content/myfile.xlsx
```

## Expected Output
- A validation report (`validation_report.docx`) with:
  - **Generated validation rules** and explanations.
  - **Errors found in the dataset** (missing values, incorrect data types, etc.).
  - **Anomaly descriptions** with specific details on suspicious values.

## Example Anomaly Output
```
🚨 Row 12 is an anomaly. Suspicious values: Total_Assets: 50,000,000, Net_Profit: -5,000,000
🚨 Row 27 is an anomaly. Suspicious values: Liabilities: 200,000,000
```

## Notes
- Works best with structured financial data.
- Can be extended with additional rule sets for compliance.
